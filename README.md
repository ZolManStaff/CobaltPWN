CobaltPWN is a powerful framework for comprehensive web application and network security testing, designed for information security professionals. Combining an intuitive interface with advanced tools, it allows you to effectively identify and eliminate vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, XSS, CSRF, RFI, LFI, XXE and many others.

Key features of the framework:

Network scanning to detect open ports, active services and analyze network structures.
Stress testing to assess the load on servers and identify vulnerabilities related to denial of service.
Generate PDF reports containing detailed test results, including identified vulnerabilities, recommendations for elimination and a description of testing methods.
Additional modules:

C2 SERVER is a tool for centralized botnet management, ideal for attack modeling and infrastructure security testing.
METASCAN is an integration of the power of Nmap and Metasploit in a convenient graphical interface. Allows scanning, exploitation and logging of all actions in real time.
Supported languages:
The framework is implemented using Python, C# and Shell, which provides flexibility, speed and the ability to integrate with other tools.

Important recommendations for work:
Add the directory with the program to the antivirus exceptions. Some antiviruses may mistakenly delete files associated with payloads due to their potential "danger".
If you have doubts, you can manually check all payloads through services such as VirusTotal to ensure their safety.
CobaltPWN is a universal tool for conducting penetration tests and security assessments, combining advanced technology and ease of use for maximum efficiency.
